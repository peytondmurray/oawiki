# Ernest's List

Ernest of the [astro-talks.ru](https://astro-talks.ru) forum has been
single-handedly making objective comparisons between eyepieces possible. The
table below has been adapted from DarkDiver's tables, which themselves were
modified from Ernest's original [post in the astro-talks eyepieces
forum][astro-talks-post]. DarkDiver split Ernest's list into separate standard
and zoom tables, and added measured field stops and calculated AFOV.
